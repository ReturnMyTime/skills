# Personalization

Some skills can load user context from `user/context.md` inside the skill folder.

To personalize a skill:

1. Copy the template:

```bash
cp templates/user/context.md.template skill-packs/<category>/<skill-name>/user/context.md
```

2. Fill in your business details.
3. Re-run the skill in your agent.
