## Hook Types & Formulas

### 1. Contrarian Hook

Challenges conventional wisdom or popular beliefs. Creates cognitive dissonance that demands attention.

**Formula:**
- "Everyone says [common belief], but [contrarian take]"
- "Stop [common practice]. Here's what works instead:"
- "Unpopular opinion: [bold stance]"
- "[Popular advice] is killing your [goal]. Here's why:"

**Why it works:** Positions you as a thought leader. The bizarreness effect makes contrarian views more memorable. Drives massive engagement through debate.

**Example:**
```
Topic: Productivity tips

Hook: "Productivity apps are making you less productive. I deleted all of mine and 3x'd my output."
```

---

### 2. Bold Statement Hook

Opens with a declarative sentence that makes a surprising or provocative claim.

**Formula:**
- "[Strong claim that sounds almost unbelievable]"
- "I [achievement] and it only took [surprising element]"
- "The [industry/topic] doesn't want you to know this:"
- "[Number]% of [group] are doing [thing] wrong"

**Why it works:** Pattern interrupt. Our brains are wired to pay attention to confidence. Bold statements signal expertise and authority.

**Example:**
```
Topic: Writing online

Hook: "I've written 500+ threads. 90% of what you've been taught about hooks is wrong."
```

---

### 3. Curiosity Gap Hook

Creates an information gap between what the reader knows and what they want to know.

**Formula:**
- "I discovered something about [topic] that changed everything:"
- "There's a reason [observation]. Most people never figure it out."
- "After [experience], I'll never [action] the same way again."
- "The real reason [thing happens] (it's not what you think)"

**Why it works:** Our brains hate unresolved questions. The curiosity gap creates psychological tension that can only be resolved by reading on.

**Example:**
```
Topic: Career growth

Hook: "I got promoted 3 times in 18 months. It had nothing to do with working harder."
```

---

### 4. Question Hook

Asks a thought-provoking question that sparks curiosity or self-reflection.

**Formula:**
- "What if [challenging assumption]?"
- "Why do [successful people] always [observation]?"
- "Have you ever noticed [pattern]?"
- "What's the difference between [A] and [B]? (It's not what you think)"

**Why it works:** Questions activate the brain differently than statements. Avoid yes/no questions—use "why," "how," or "what" questions that demand explanations.

**Example:**
```
Topic: Building habits

Hook: "Why do some habits stick in days while others take months? The answer isn't discipline."
```

---

### 5. Story Hook

Opens with a personal narrative or anecdote that draws readers in emotionally.

**Formula:**
- "[Time reference], I [situation]. Then [turning point]."
- "I was [relatable struggle]. Until I discovered [insight]."
- "3 years ago, I [past state]. Today, I [transformed state]. Here's what changed:"
- "My [mentor/boss/client] told me something I'll never forget:"

**Why it works:** Stories bypass logical resistance. We're wired to pay attention to narratives. Creates relatability and trust.

**Example:**
```
Topic: Starting a business

Hook: "2 years ago, I was drowning in a 9-5 I hated. Last month, I crossed $50k/month. Here's the unconventional path I took:"
```

---

### 6. Data/Shocking Fact Hook

Uses surprising statistics or counterintuitive data to create a pattern interrupt.

**Formula:**
- "[Surprising statistic]. Here's what it means for [audience]:"
- "[Number]% of [group] fail at [goal]. The [small percentage] who succeed all do this:"
- "I analyzed [sample size]. The results surprised me:"
- "The data doesn't lie: [unexpected finding]"

**Why it works:** Specificity creates credibility. Surprising data creates cognitive dissonance. Numbers stand out in a sea of opinions.

**Example:**
```
Topic: Content creation

Hook: "94% of Twitter threads get fewer than 10 retweets. After analyzing 10,000 viral threads, I found the 3 patterns the top 6% share:"
```

---

### 7. Outcome/Transformation Hook

Promises a specific result or transformation the reader can achieve.

**Formula:**
- "How to [achieve outcome] in [timeframe] (without [common obstacle])"
- "[Number] [things] that took me from [before state] to [after state]"
- "Do this for [timeframe] and watch your [metric] [improvement]"
- "The [number]-step framework I used to [achieve result]:"

**Why it works:** Clearly communicates value upfront. Specificity (numbers, timeframes) increases believability. Addresses both desire and objections.

**Example:**
```
Topic: Growing on Twitter

Hook: "How I grew from 0 to 20,000 followers in 6 months (spending just 2 hours per day):"
```

---

### 8. Problem/Pain Hook

Addresses a specific struggle or pain point your audience experiences.

**Formula:**
- "Struggling with [pain point]? You're not alone. Here's what actually works:"
- "If [relatable struggle], this thread will change everything."
- "The [pain point] nobody talks about (and how to fix it):"
- "[Pain point] is costing you [consequence]. Stop doing this:"

**Why it works:** Demonstrates you understand your audience. Pain is a stronger motivator than pleasure. Creates immediate relevance.

**Example:**
```
Topic: Freelancing

Hook: "Struggling to find clients? Stop applying to job boards. Here's the strategy that books my calendar 3 months out:"
```

---

## Workflow

### 1. Understand the Topic
- Identify the core insight or value being shared
- Determine the target audience
- Note the platform context (character limits, audience expectations)

### 2. Check for Context
- Load `user/context.md` if present
- Apply niche-specific language and audience understanding
- Match the user's established voice and tone

### 3. Generate Hook Variations
For each topic, generate hooks using at least 5 different types:
- Select the most appropriate hook types for the content
- Ensure variety in approach and psychological trigger
- Keep hooks concise (aim for 1-2 lines)

### 4. Present Options
Format output as:

## Your Hooks for: Why most startups fail in year one

### 🎯 Contrarian
90% of startup advice will kill your company. After watching 50+ startups fail, here's what actually matters:

### 💥 Bold Statement
Most startups don't fail because of bad ideas. They fail because founders ignore this one thing:

### 🔮 Curiosity Gap
I've worked with 50+ startups. The ones that failed all had something in common—and it wasn't funding.

### ❓ Question
Why do startups with $1M in funding fail while bootstrapped companies thrive? The answer isn't what VCs tell you.

### 📖 Story
I watched my first startup burn through $500k in 8 months. We had everything—except the one thing that mattered:

### 📊 Data/Shocking Fact
90% of startups fail. But here's what nobody tells you: 70% of those failures were preventable with one simple shift:

How to survive your first year as a startup (the framework that took us from near-death to profitability):

### 😤 Problem/Pain
Burning cash with no traction? You're not alone. Here's the brutal truth about startup survival:

---

**Recommended:** The Data/Shocking Fact hook—it combines credibility (specific stat) with a curiosity gap (preventable how?). Perfect for establishing authority in a thread about startup lessons.

### Example 2: Personal Development Topic

**Input:**
```
Topic: Morning routines are overrated
Platform: LinkedIn
```

**Output:**

## Your Hooks for: Morning routines are overrated

### 🎯 Contrarian
Morning routines won't make you successful. I stopped waking up at 5am and my productivity doubled.

### 💥 Bold Statement
I've tried every morning routine. Most are complete wastes of time. Here's what I do instead:

### 🔮 Curiosity Gap
The most productive people I know don't have morning routines. They have something else entirely:

### ❓ Question
What if your morning routine is actually holding you back? Here's a question worth asking:

### 📖 Story
I spent 2 years waking up at 5am, meditating, journaling, exercising. I was exhausted and miserable. Then I changed one thing:

### 📊 Data/Shocking Fact
I tracked my productivity for 365 days. The data showed my morning routine had zero correlation with my output.

### 🚀 Outcome/Transformation
How I 2x'd my productivity by abandoning the "perfect morning routine" myth:

### 😤 Problem/Pain
Exhausted from forcing yourself through a morning routine that doesn't work? You might be solving the wrong problem:

---

**Recommended:** The Story hook—LinkedIn audiences respond well to personal narratives. The 2-year journey creates credibility and the transformation creates curiosity.

## Guidelines

- Keep hooks to 1-2 lines maximum (under 280 characters for Twitter)
- Use specific numbers over vague claims ("3x'd my output" vs "improved my output")
- Match hook intensity to content depth—don't overpromise
- Avoid clickbait—every hook should be backed by real content
- Test multiple hooks; what works varies by audience and platform
- Consider the emotional trigger: curiosity, fear, desire, belonging

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Hooks feel generic | Add specific numbers, timeframes, or personal details |
| Too clickbaity | Ensure the content delivers on the hook's promise |
| Not getting engagement | Try contrarian or question hooks—they invite responses |
| Hooks are too long | Cut to the core claim; remove filler words |
| Same hook type works every time | Vary your hooks to avoid audience fatigue |
