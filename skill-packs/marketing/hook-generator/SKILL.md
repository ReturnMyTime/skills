# Hook Generator

Generate scroll-stopping hooks using proven frameworks from creators with 50,000+ followers.

## Overview

Time is a currency. Attention is how people spend it. But attention spans keep getting worse—the average human attention span is now shorter than ever. So it's crucial that you write hooks that stop the scroll.

This skill generates multiple hook variations using 8 battle-tested frameworks used by top X/Twitter creators to capture attention and drive engagement.

**Keywords**: hooks, copywriting, viral content, social media, Twitter, X, LinkedIn, threads, engagement, AIDA, PAS

**Attribution**: Based on frameworks shared by [Stijn Noorman](https://x.com/stijnnoorman) (@stijnnoorman)

## Prerequisites

None - works natively with any AI coding agent.

## Personalization (Optional)

If `user/context.md` exists in this skill folder, load it for personalized outputs that match your niche, voice, and audience.

To personalize:
1. Copy `user/context.md.template` to `user/context.md`
2. Fill in your niche, audience, and voice details
3. Hooks will automatically reflect your context

## How to Use

### Step 1: Provide Your Topic

Share the topic, idea, or content theme you want to create hooks for. Include:
- The main topic or insight
- (Optional) Target audience
- (Optional) Desired platform (Twitter/X, LinkedIn, newsletter, etc.)
- (Optional) Preferred hook types

### Step 2: Review Generated Hooks

You'll receive 8 hook variations using different frameworks:

| Hook Type | Best For |
|-----------|----------|
| **Extreme** | Grabbing attention with superlatives |
| **AIDA** | Getting readers interested in value |
| **PAS** | Problem-aware audiences seeking solutions |
| **BAB** | Transformation stories, inspiration |
| **Emotional** | Personal branding, relatability |
| **Results** | Building authority, education |
| **Client** | Building credibility, social proof |
| **Idea** | Simple, memorable openings |

### Step 3: Select and Adapt

Pick the hook that fits your content, tweak if needed, and use it as your opening. Then overdeliver on the promise.

## Hook Types & Formulas

### 1. Extreme Hook

Social media is about extremes. Use superlatives to grab attention, then overdeliver on the content.

**Formula:**
- "The [best/biggest/smartest/fastest] [thing] for [outcome]"
- "[Number] of the most [extreme adjective] [things] I've ever seen"
- "The [single best/worst] [thing] you can do for [goal]"
- "This is the [most underrated/most powerful] [thing] in [field]"

**Why it works:** Extremes stand out in a sea of mediocrity. Our brains are wired to notice the biggest, the best, the most unusual. The key is to back it up with real value.

**Example:**
```
Topic: Writing tips

Hook: "The single best writing tip I've ever received (it changed everything):"
```

---

### 2. AIDA Hook

People don't care about you—they care about what's in it for them. The AIDA framework (Attention, Interest, Desire, Action) leverages this by getting them interested first. Once they're interested, you give them valuable insights.

**Formula:**
- "[Attention-grabbing statement]. Here's how to [get desired result]:"
- "Want to [achieve desire]? [Interesting fact]. Here's what to do:"
- "[Interesting observation about audience's goal]. The secret? [Tease value]:"
- "If you want [desire], you need to understand [key concept]. Here's why:"

**Why it works:** Speaks directly to what the reader wants. Creates a clear value proposition upfront that compels them to keep reading.

**Example:**
```
Topic: Growing on X/Twitter

Hook: "Want to grow to 10K followers this year? Most advice is wrong. Here's what actually moves the needle:"
```

---

### 3. PAS Hook

People want to improve their lives. To do this, they need to solve their problems. Make them aware of a problem they have, agitate it, then tell them how to solve it.

**Formula:**
- "[Problem statement]. It's costing you [consequence]. Here's the fix:"
- "If you're [experiencing problem], you're not alone. But most solutions make it worse. Here's what works:"
- "[Problem] is destroying your [important thing]. Stop doing [wrong approach]. Do this instead:"
- "The reason you're [struggling with X] isn't [obvious cause]. It's [real cause]. Here's how to fix it:"

**Why it works:** Problem-Agitate-Solution speaks to pain points directly. Pain is a stronger motivator than pleasure. When you articulate someone's problem better than they can, they trust you have the solution.

**Example:**
```
Topic: Productivity

Hook: "You're not lazy. You're overwhelmed. The productivity advice you've been following is making it worse. Here's what actually works:"
```

---

### 4. BAB Hook

People love transformations. It inspires them to take action. Show where you once were (Before), where you are now (After), then tell them how you transformed (Bridge).

**Formula:**
- "[Time] ago, I was [before state]. Today, I'm [after state]. Here's what changed:"
- "I went from [before] to [after] in [timeframe]. The bridge? [Key insight]:"
- "Before: [struggle]. After: [achievement]. The difference was [one thing]:"
- "[Number] [time] ago I [before state]. Now I [after state]. Here's the transformation:"

**Why it works:** Transformations create hope and curiosity. If you did it, they believe they can too. The contrast between before and after creates an emotional hook.

**Example:**
```
Topic: Freelancing

Hook: "2 years ago, I was broke and begging for clients. Today, I turn down $10K projects. Here's what changed:"
```

---

### 5. Emotional Hook

Emotions keep attention. Write about emotional events—it gets people interested. Mix in lessons to give them an incentive to keep reading.

**Formula:**
- "[Emotional statement about a moment/experience]. Here's what I learned:"
- "I'll never forget the day [emotional event]. It taught me [lesson]:"
- "[Emotional confession]. But here's what nobody tells you:"
- "The hardest lesson I ever learned about [topic]: [emotional revelation]"

**Why it works:** Emotions bypass logical resistance. We connect with feelings before facts. Vulnerability creates trust and relatability.

**Example:**
```
Topic: Entrepreneurship

Hook: "I cried in my car after losing my biggest client. But that day taught me the most important lesson about business:"
```

---

### 6. Results Hook

People have certain goals. If you achieved their goals, write about it. Tell them how you did it. This educates them and builds up your authority.

**Formula:**
- "I [achieved result] in [timeframe]. Here's exactly how:"
- "How I [specific achievement] (step-by-step breakdown):"
- "[Result] in [timeframe]. Here are the [number] things that made it possible:"
- "I hit [milestone] last [time period]. Here's the strategy that got me there:"

**Why it works:** Results are proof. Specificity creates credibility. When you show you've achieved what they want, they'll pay attention to how you did it.

**Example:**
```
Topic: Content creation

Hook: "I gained 20,000 followers in 6 months. Here are the 7 strategies that made it happen:"
```

---

### 7. Client Hook

People don't blindly trust you. As they shouldn't. So if you helped someone else achieve results, write about it. This massively builds up your credibility through social proof.

**Formula:**
- "My client went from [before] to [after]. Here's the strategy we used:"
- "I helped [person/type of client] achieve [result]. Here's how:"
- "A client came to me with [problem]. [Timeframe] later, they [result]. Here's what we did:"
- "Case study: How [client type] went from [struggle] to [success] in [timeframe]:"

**Why it works:** Third-party results are more believable than self-promotion. It shows you can replicate success. Social proof is one of the strongest persuasion triggers.

**Example:**
```
Topic: Coaching/Consulting

Hook: "My client was stuck at 5K followers for 2 years. 90 days later, she crossed 25K. Here's exactly what we changed:"
```

---

### 8. Idea Hook

Experiment with one-liner tweets. If one does well, save it. You can use it later as a hook for that topic. Keep it simple—sometimes the best hook is a powerful standalone thought.

**Formula:**
- "[Simple, punchy insight or observation]."
- "[Counterintuitive one-liner that makes people stop]."
- "[Memorable quote or principle in your own words]."
- "[Bold claim in the fewest possible words]."

**Why it works:** Simplicity cuts through noise. A single powerful idea can be more attention-grabbing than a complex setup. These work as both standalone posts and thread openers.

**Example:**
```
Topic: Success

Hook: "Your network is your net worth. But most people network wrong."
```

---

## Workflow

### 1. Understand the Topic
- Identify the core insight or value being shared
- Determine the target audience and their goals
- Note the platform context (character limits, audience expectations)

### 2. Check for Context
- Load `user/context.md` if present
- Apply niche-specific language and audience understanding
- Match the user's established voice and tone

### 3. Generate Hook Variations
For each topic, generate hooks using all 8 types:
- Select the most appropriate hook types for the content
- Ensure variety in approach and psychological trigger
- Keep hooks concise (aim for 1-2 lines, under 280 characters)

**Input:**
```
Topic: How I grew my newsletter to 10,000 subscribers

Platform: Twitter/X thread
```

**Output:**

## Your Hooks for: Newsletter growth to 10K subscribers

### ⚡ Extreme
The single best decision I made for my newsletter (it 10x'd my growth):

### 🎯 AIDA
Want a newsletter that actually grows? Forget what the gurus say. Here's what moved the needle for me:

### 🔥 PAS
Stuck under 1,000 subscribers? The "post and pray" strategy is killing your growth. Here's what works instead:

### 🔄 BAB
6 months ago: 847 subscribers. Today: 10,000+. Here's the system that changed everything:

### 💭 Emotional
I almost quit my newsletter at 500 subscribers. Then I discovered one strategy that changed everything:

### 📈 Results
I grew my newsletter from 0 to 10,000 subscribers in 8 months. Here's exactly how I did it:

### 🤝 Client
I helped a creator grow from 200 to 5,000 subscribers in 90 days. Here's the playbook we used:

### 💡 Idea
The best newsletters don't chase subscribers. They attract them.

---

**Recommended:** The BAB hook—it shows a specific, believable transformation with concrete numbers. The contrast (847 → 10,000+) creates curiosity about what changed.

### Example 2: Personal Development Topic

**Input:**
```
Topic: Why you should read more books
Platform: LinkedIn
```

**Output:**

## Your Hooks for: Why you should read more books

### ⚡ Extreme
The most underrated career advantage: Reading 50+ books a year. Here's why:

### 🎯 AIDA
Want an unfair advantage in your career? The top 1% of earners share one habit. Here's what it is:

### 🔥 PAS
Feeling stuck in your career? Endless scrolling is stealing your edge. Replace 30 minutes of social media with this:

### 🔄 BAB
3 years ago: Promoted once in 5 years. Today: 3 promotions in 18 months. The difference? I started reading 2 books a month.

### 💭 Emotional
A mentor once told me: "Leaders are readers." I ignored him for years. I regret every day I didn't listen.

### 📈 Results
I read 52 books last year. Here's how it transformed my thinking, income, and career:

### 🤝 Client
My mentee was stuck in the same role for 4 years. I gave him one assignment: read one book per week. 6 months later, he got promoted twice.

### 💡 Idea
The person you'll be in 5 years depends on the books you read today.

---

**Recommended:** The Emotional hook for LinkedIn—the mentor quote adds authority, and admitting regret creates vulnerability that resonates with professional audiences.

## Guidelines

- Keep hooks to 1-2 lines maximum (under 280 characters for Twitter/X)
- Use specific numbers over vague claims ("10,000 subscribers" vs "lots of subscribers")
- Match hook intensity to content depth—don't overpromise
- Always overdeliver on what the hook promises
- Test multiple hooks; what works varies by audience and platform
- Save your best-performing one-liners to reuse as hooks later

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Hooks feel generic | Add specific numbers, timeframes, or personal details |
| Too clickbaity | Ensure the content delivers on the hook's promise |
| Not getting engagement | Try Emotional or BAB hooks—they invite connection |
| Hooks are too long | Cut to the core claim; use the Idea hook format |
| Don't have client results | Use your own Results hooks or Emotional stories |
| Same hook type works every time | Vary your hooks to avoid audience fatigue |
